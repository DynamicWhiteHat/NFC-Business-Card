# NFC-Business-Card
An NFC Business Card created for HackClub Highway

# Features

- NFC enabled, allowing a user to tap their device to be sent to my personal website
- QR code pointing to my Instagram account
- Link to my website and my github username
- Some silkscreen art to make the card look nice
- AND designed following CR80 dimensions, allowing it to fit (almost) anywhere normal US cards can!

# Why I made the project

I created this business card in the past as my first PCB using HackClub Onboard. However, I messed it up by shorting the traces by attempting to make my silkscreen shiny by using the top layer and a top soldermask layer. I attempted to fix this in this revision while also making it CR80 compliant, which is another point I noticed from my last design.
